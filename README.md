# negative-or-positive
a python bot who detects of a text is negative or positive 
**how to use**:
  type in your terminal:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/heegarthur/negative-or-positive
    ```
  and navigate to the project and type this:

  this script doesn't work really good becease the ai needs  more training, I will update this if I have a more trained ai.
